Data Cleaning
1) Remove Missing Values

Identify missing entries in critical fields:

SELECT *
FROM weather_data
WHERE temperature IS NULL
   OR windspeed IS NULL
   OR winddirection IS NULL
   OR weathercode IS NULL;


If missing values are detected, either fill or remove them depending on the case.
For this dataset, rows with missing temperature values were remove:

DELETE FROM weather_data
WHERE temperature IS NULL;

2) Ensure Correct Data Types

To maintain schema consistency and avoid analytical errors, data types were standardized:

ALTER TABLE weather_data
MODIFY latitude FLOAT,
MODIFY longitude FLOAT,
MODIFY temperature FLOAT,
MODIFY windspeed FLOAT,
MODIFY winddirection FLOAT,
MODIFY weathercode INT;

3) Remove Duplicate Records

Weather APIs can return repeated timestamps for the same coordinates.
Duplicates are removed by keeping the earliest entry:

DELETE t1
FROM weather_data t1
INNER JOIN weather_data t2
  ON t1.latitude = t2.latitude
 AND t1.longitude = t2.longitude
 AND t1.timestamp > t2.timestamp;
